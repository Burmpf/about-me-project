        <h2>A Brief Bio</h2>
        <p>This page is going to be a little about me like: education, job experience, and some other fun bits.</p>
        <p>Originally I'm from Indiana, the good ol' midwest. Life has since taken me far from home so that I'm now settled in South Carolina. I got out of the Marine Corps about a year and a half ago and since then I've gone from no hair to a mullet and back to no hair again! I'm here at Code Fellows so I can find a new path and change my family's and my future for the better!</p>
        <p>As far as education goes there's not much of it. I graduated high school and went straight into the military. After I got out I tried my hand at college while doing an apprenticeship and I slowly grew to hate it so I quit and tried crypto full time (right before the huge dip).</p>
        As for job experience, the story is mostly the same. Joined the military striaight out of high school and did that for 4 VERY long years. After I got out I tried out an apprenticeship in a factory building gas tanks. I hated it after a while and by then I was very deep into crypto/NFT's. I had a project I was working for that ended up tanking. Welcome to the world of start-ups. Now here I am! 
        <p>My goal with this class is to be able to go back into crypto and be able to build something of my own. I have a few ideas, now I just need the ability to execute. </p>
