        <h2>A Brief Bio</h2>
        <p>This page is going to be a little about me like: education, job experience, and some other fun bits.</p>
        <p>Originally I'm from Indiana, the good ol' midwest. Life has since taken me far from home so that I'm now settled in South Carolina. I got out of the Marine Corps about a year and a half ago and since then I've gone from no hair to a mullet and back to no hair again! I'm here at Code Fellows so I can find a new path and change my family's and my future for the better!</p>
        <br>
